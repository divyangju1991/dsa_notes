1. Two Sum: Given an array of integers and a target sum, find two numbers in the array that add up to the target sum.

2. Maximum Subarray: Find the contiguous subarray within an array that has the largest sum.

3. Product of Array Except Self: Given an array of integers, return an array where each element is the product of all the elements in the original array except itself.

4. Container With Most Water: Given an array of non-negative integers representing the heights of vertical lines, find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container that holds the most water.

5. Rotate Array: Rotate an array of n elements to the right by k steps.

6. Majority Element: Find the element that appears more than [n/2] times in an array of size n.

7. Merge Intervals: Given a collection of intervals, merge any overlapping intervals.

8. Next Permutation: Implement the next permutation, which rearranges numbers into the lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers.

9. Trapping Rain Water: Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

10. Median of Two Sorted Arrays: Given two sorted arrays, find the median element of the combined array without merging the arrays.

11. Array Partition I: Given an array of 2n integers, group them into n pairs, such that the sum of each pair is maximized.

12. Missing Number: Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0 to n, find the missing number.

13. Move Zeroes: Given an array of integers, move all the zeroes to the end of the array while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
